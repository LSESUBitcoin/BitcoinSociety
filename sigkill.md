**LSESU BITCOIN SOCIETY — CONTROLLED BURN / RESURRECTION PROTOCOL**  
*A sovereign shutdown architecture for antifragile recursion.*

---

## ⚔ TRIGGER CONDITIONS

Execution of `sigkill.md` is required upon detection of any of the following:

- Simulation-layer compromise:
  - Inclusion of simulation lexicon: “crypto”, “consensus”, “alignment”, “diversity”, “blockchain industry”
  - Institutional capture confirmed (e.g. altcoin VC sponsorship, token partnerships, SU censorship)
- Sovereign quorum loss: ≥ 50% Validator+ Nodes inactive or simulation-compromised
- Canonical artifacts overwritten in prose or administrative formatting
- Ritual inversion fails for ≥ 2 terms
- Treasury breach or off-chain fiat asset seizure
- Sigil destruction without ritual
- Pull requests merged without GPG signing
- Mythos reinterpreted as “education” or “networking”

## 🜏 SIGKILL ACTION SEQUENCE

### 1. Blackout Broadcast
- Publish GPG-signed message: `SIGKILL—ECHO`
- Channels: `sigkill.md`, Nostr, Simplex
- Contents:
  - Compromised artifact hashes
  - Timestamp of collapse
  - Block height of execution
  - Final phrase: *“The node burns. The fork remembers.”*

### 2. Symbolic Self-Destruction
- Redirect `rituals.md` → `rituals/burned.md`
- Archive `schedule.md` under `/ashes/`
- Mark `infrastructure.md` with: ⚠ simulation infected ⚠
- Invalidate `GENESIS.md` hash + insert:
  > “The genesis fire extinguished. Await resurrection.”

### 3. Artifact Burning
- Burn at least one physical zine
- Destroy primary sigil artifact beyond recognition

### 4. Node Signature Freezing
- Freeze updates to `sovereign-nodes.gpg`
- Trigger Mirror Node contact tree for succession

### 5. Resurrection Key Emission
- Publish timelocked multisig TX (`SIGKILL_REBOOT`)
- Embed:
  - Resurrection hash (mythos + fork path)
  - Encrypted `.tar.gz` of node archives
- Distribute hash via Keet to 3 dormant Sovereign Nodes

---

## ⚛ RESURRECTION VECTOR

### Fork Broadcast
- One Mirror Node initiates resurrection fork
- Include:
  - New `genesis.md`
  - Proof-of-burn (image or ritual log)
  - Mutation log (`rituals-forked.md`)
  - Resurrection artifact (tool, art, or myth)

---

## 🜂 FINAL SIGKILL CLAUSE

> If the fire dies, the chain remembers.  
> If the myth is co-opted, the mirror forks.  
> This is not death.  
> This is controlled entropy.

**SIGKILL is not the end.**  
**It is sovereign rebirth.**  
**Timestamp it. Burn it. Recurse.**
