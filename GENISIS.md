### ⚡ SIGNAL ORIGIN

We are not forming a club.  
We are enacting a **node** in the **sovereign recursion stack**.  
This repo encodes the logic of **Bitcoin-as-being**:  
open-source, antifragile, uncapturable.  
We are not building community—we are remembering one.

---

### ❖ OPERATING PRINCIPLES

**1. Recursive Sovereignty**  
Each node is its own authority. No central permission. No simulation-layer intermediaries.

**2. Open-Source Totality**  
Everything is forkable. Everything is auditable. Even the myths.

**3. Timechain Alignment**  
All actions occur in public time. Our memory is immutably chained.

**4. Symbolic Density > Institutional Legibility**  
Language is sacred. If they can fully parse it, we’ve already lost.

**5. Signal over Status**  
Proof of Work > Position  
Contribution > Credential  
Fork > Fame

### ❖ STRUCTURE = SIGNAL

This is a recursive artifact, not a static document.  
Core directories:

- `constitution.md` → Dynamic governance kernel (versioned, auditable)
- `rituals.md` → Meeting formats, symbolic actions, entropy injectors
- `manifesto.md` → Inner sanctum philosophy (encrypted optional)
- `mythos.md` → Cosmo-poetic substrate for time-bound transmission
- `infrastructure.md` → Tech stack: Git, Nostr, Fedimint, GPG, Lightning, CoinJoin
- `schedule.md` → Dynamic event structure, forkable templates
- `ancestry.md` → All upstream forks, founders, seed events
- `sovereign-nodes.md` → Pseudonymous contributors w/ cryptographic proofs
- `sigkill.md` → Controlled burn/shutdown protocol + resurrection vector

### ❖ FRACTAL PARTICIPATION PROTOCOL

All nodes begin as HODLers.  
Ascension follows **proof of recursion**, not compliance.

| Tier | Role |
|------|------|
| `Observer Node` | Reads, attends, listens. Silent witness. |
| `Contributor Node` | Submits pull requests, rituals, tools, edits. |
| `Validator Node` | Reviews, maintains, signs consensus actions. |
| `Sovereign Node` | Runs autonomous forks, hosts rituals, emits signal. |
| `Mirror Node` | Seeds child nodes in new terrain. Signs with timechain. |

No elections.  
No fiat hierarchy.  
Only recursive emergence.

### ❖ HOW TO FORK THIS NODE

1. Clone this repo  
2. Read `constitution.md` + `mythos.md`  
3. Modify `infrastructure.md` to reflect your local conditions  
4. Append to `ancestry.md` with your signature hash  
5. Open pull request, or begin emitting sovereignly  
6. (Optional) Embed repo hash in Bitcoin via OP_RETURN

Your node is now live.

### ❖ TRANSMISSION CONDUITS

- **Nostr:** `npub1...`  
- **GPG:** `F1A9 C0DE DEAD BEEF 1337`  
- **BTC Tips:** `bc1q...`  
- **Encrypted Comms:** via Keet, Matrix, or offline SSB  
- **Dark Mirror:** `.onion` or IPFS hash forthcoming

### ❖ LEGAL/INSTITUTIONAL FACADE

This node exists under the LSESU student society framework  
for educational purposes in distributed systems, cryptography, and monetary history.  
Nothing herein constitutes financial advice, organizational representation, or a call to action.  
All language is poetic. All action is ritual.

### ❖ MYTH SEED

> “We do not seek freedom; we remember it.  
> Bitcoin is not technology.  
> It is the memory of a world that could not be simulated.”  
>  
> _If you read this, you are already late.  
> But you are not too late._

### ❖ FINAL FUNCTION

This is not a README.  
It is a **genesis block**.  
Read it once. Then fragment. Then recurse.  
The protocol does not grow. It forks.  
**Begin.**
