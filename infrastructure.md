**LSESU BITCOIN SOCIETY — SOVEREIGN STACK INFRASTRUCTURE**  
*Tools as mirror. Stack as sigil. Architecture as myth.*

> “This is not infrastructure.  
> This is the memory of a world that could not be simulated.”

## ⚡ SOVEREIGN STACK OVERVIEW

All infrastructure is open-source, offline-operable, forkable, ritualized.  
No dependencies on Google, Meta, Ethereum, Discord, or simulation-layer ID systems.

Each tool must:  
- Preserve symbolic entropy  
- Be runnable under authoritarian collapse conditions  
- Mirror the values of Bitcoin: transparency, immutability, decentralization, sovereignty

---

## ✪ CORE STACK COMPONENTS

### ⟁ CODE + COORDINATION

- **Git (CLI, GitHub, Codeberg)** → All club materials versioned; commits = ritual logs  
- **GPG (GnuPG)** → Identity verification via cryptographic signatures  
- **Make.md / Obsidian (local only)** → Clean markdown-first knowledge garden (no Notion)  
- **LaTeX / Pandoc** → PDF production for print zines, sigil manifestos

### ⟁ COMMUNICATION

- **Nostr** → Primary sovereign social protocol; supports pseudonymous ops + Lightning tips  
- **SimpleX** → Internal asynchronous channel  
- **Keet (peer-to-peer)** → Inner sanctum convos; symbolic-only comms, never scheduling  
- **SSB (Secure Scuttlebutt)** → Optional mesh for off-grid, offline gossip sync  
- **Signal** → Fallback normie-onboarding vector (ritualize exit)

### ⟁ BITCOIN TOOLCHAIN

- **Sparrow Wallet** → UTXO management, coin control, PSBT creation  
- **SeedSigner** → Airgapped key gen/signing; requires 0 internet exposure  
- **Specter DIY / Specter Desktop** → Full multisig stack; wallet policy visible on-chain  
- **Fedimint** → Community custody experiments; used only post-ritual of Trust Confession  
- **BTCPay Server (Tor + .onion only)** → Merchant/payments tool; no fiat, no tracking  
- **LND or Core Lightning (optional)** → Lightning routing node ops; not mandatory for all  
- **RTL / ThunderHub** → Lightning UX dashboards; routed via Tor/I2P only  
- **Mempool.space (self-hosted)** → TX analysis; block height = sacred clock

---

## ✪ OPSEC + STORAGE

- **Tails OS / Qubes OS** → Operational environments for high-security rituals  
- **Veracrypt** → Encrypted local ritual archives; key-split across Sovereign Nodes  
- **Shamir Secret Sharing (Sparrow / SeedTool)** → Secret splitting for multisig resilience  
- **USB Sneakernet Protocols** → PaperOps fallback for total network loss  
- **Airgapped Raspberry Pi + SeedSigner OS** → Physical ritual layer; signing station

---

## ✪ DISTRIBUTED PUBLISHING + MEMORY LAYER

- **IPFS / Pinata / Eternum** → All zines, `.md` files, manifestos published on-chain/off-chain hybrid  
- **Arweave (limited use)** → Immutable zine fragments (if entropy requirement met)  
- **Git-ssb** → P2P git syncing for offline node propagations  
- **Ghost or Hugo (Markdown blog engine)** → Public mirror of events & rituals  

---

## ✪ SYMBOLIC TOOLS + RITUALIZATION

- **ZK-Proofs (SnarkJS)** → Used for secret knowledge transmission; proof-of-silence  
- **Ascii-AI (stable-diffusion-txt2ascii)** → Meme + sigil generation via latent entropy  
- **Paper Wallet Generator (local only)** → Print-only BTC artifacts, one-time use  
- **Custom Entropy Dice** → Ritualized key entropy generation  
- **BTCR DID (Decentralized Identity)** → Identity layer experiments, not primary auth

---

## ✪ NODE INITIATION ENVIRONMENT

- **Bitcoin Core (pruned, Tor)** → Full node; mandatory for Sovereign Node rite  
- **Zeus Wallet (mobile, Tor-only)** → Optional mobile interface for on-the-go testing  
- **Miniscript / Policy Compiler (HWI)** → Advanced key path experiments  
- **Electrs (local Electrum server)** → Sovereign querying of UTXO set  
- **Jade / BitBox02 (optional hardware)** → Hardware wallet for normie safety fallback only

---

## ✪ FAILOVER / RESURRECTION LAYERS

- `/paperops/README.md` → Ritual handbook for infrastructure recovery during collapse  
- `rituals/infra_eclipse.md` → Termly audit of stack by adversarial node  
- `sigkill.md` → Shutdown + resurrection protocol, ensures soft death + hard rebirth  
- `deadweight/` → Decoy files, honeypot links, checksum mismatches for simulation-layer detection  
- `sovereign-nodes.gpg` → Signed registry of verified contributors (required quarterly)

---

## ✪ RITUAL-MANDATED POLICIES

- **All PRs must be signed w/ GPG**  
- **No address reuse. No third-party custody. No Google integrations.**  
- **All tools must be usable offline within 3 minutes of grid failure.**  
- **Simulations must not parse ritual logic. Obfuscate where necessary.**

## ✪ FINAL CLAUSE

> “You are not installing software.  
> You are remembering who you are.”

> “This infrastructure will not scale.  
> It will fork.”

**This is not a tech stack.  
This is a memory algorithm encoded in entropy,  
maintained by sovereigns,  
across fire, collapse, and resurrection.**

**Seal it. Fork it. Immortalize it.**
