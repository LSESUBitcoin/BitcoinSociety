**LSESU BITCOIN SOCIETY ‚Äî SEMESTER BLOCK STRUCTURE**  
*Not a calendar. A signal-timed, entropy-governed propagation ritual.*  

---

## ‚ö°Ô∏èBLOCK-CODED SCHEDULE PROTOCOL

**Timebase = Bitcoin block height + cosmic triggers.**  
All events subject to mutation, inversion, or forking.  
This is a living protocol, not a timetable.

---

### `BM-GENESIS`

**üîπ Genesis Invocation**  
**Trigger**: First public event block ‚â• `800_000`  
**Action**: Read `GENESIS.md` aloud. Declare:  
> ‚ÄúWe are not beginning. We are remembering.‚Äù  
**Ritual Layer**: Re-sync with origin signal. Require analog presence.

---

### `BM+21`

**üîπ Dream Transmission Circle**  
**Trigger**: 21 blocks after Genesis  
**Action**: Each node shares one dream, symbol, or vision.  
**Rule**: No interpretations. No analysis. Just recursion.  
**Symbolic Function**: Recover sovereign subconscious signals.

---

### `BM+42`

**üîπ Simulation Detection Game**  
**Trigger**: Full moon or mempool congestion > 333k  
**Action**: Nodes pitch 3 initiatives (1 real, 2 fake). Detect the simulation vector.  
**Layer**: Entropy testing of discernment under narrative pressure.

---

### `BM+88`

**üîπ Lightning Ritual Lab**  
**Trigger**: Block height divisible by 88  
**Action**:  
- Setup full node (pruned)  
- Perform first Lightning invoice tx  
- Embed hash of mythos line into invoice memo  
**Signal Test**: Node readiness. BTC operational initiation.

---

### `BM+101`

**üîπ Fork Baptism**  
**Trigger**: First confirmed fork attempt or shadow node report  
**Action**: Baptize new node via entropy juice + ritual sigil reading  
**Optional**: Burn analog artifact to seal new terrain entry.

---

### `BM+144`

**üîπ Reverse Lecture**  
**Trigger**: On 144th block from Genesis (1-day interval)  
**Action**: Speaker answers only questions. No slides, no agenda.  
**Signal Function**: Reverse simulation logic. Audience generates structure.

---

### `BM+233`

**üîπ Entropy Break**  
**Trigger**: Block divisible by 233 (Fibonacci-coded)  
**Action**: Mid-event ritual chaos: 7 minutes of non-verbal, emergent behavior.  
**Warning**: Simulation-hardened minds may short-circuit.

---

### `BM+333`

**üîπ Proof-of-Grief**  
**Trigger**: Anonymous grief node ping received  
**Action**: Keet confessional submitted. Sovereign Node ritualizes transformation or deletion.  
**Function**: Ritual entropy sink for despair ‚Üí signal transmutation.

---

### `BM+404`

**üîπ Node Resurrection Ritual**  
**Trigger**: Missing contributor / dead fork node  
**Action**:  
- Read from `ancestry.md`  
- Reach out once  
- Burn if unresponsive  
**Symbolic Output**: Respect for ghost signal. No forced return.

---

### `BM+500`

**üîπ Difficulty Adjustment Council**  
**Trigger**: Every 500th block post-Genesis  
**Action**:  
- Audit rituals  
- Fork at least one  
- Archive or invert at least one symbolic action  
**Ritual Enforcement**: Prevent ossification. Force symbolic mutation.

---

### `BM+666`

**üîπ Anti-Ritual**  
**Trigger**: Block divisible by 666  
**Action**: Randomly selected ritual is ignored, inverted, or mocked  
**Log**: `rituals-forked.md`  
**Purpose**: Immunity inoculation. Dogma destruction.

---

### `BM+777`

**üîπ External Fork Deployment**  
**Trigger**: Confirmed cryptographic activity from new campus/city  
**Action**:  
- Dispatch Sovereign or Mirror Node  
- Read `fork-seed.md`  
- Sign cross-node sigil  
**Goal**: Lateral sovereignty propagation.

---

### `BM+1008`

**üîπ Proof-of-Work Zine Drop**  
**Trigger**: Accrual of ‚â• 21 verified commit rituals  
**Action**:  
- Compile `proof-of-work.md`  
- LaTeX ‚Üí PDF  
- IPFS + local print  
**Optional**: Embed block hash as footer sigil

---

### `BM+1111`

**üîπ The Missing Block**  
**Trigger**: Cosmological signal (eclipse, CME burst, geomagnetic spike)  
**Action**:  
- Unscripted live ritual  
- No recording  
- Never repeated  
- Zero textual artifacts  
**Result**: Memory algorithm anchors permanent unsimulatable entropy

---

## ‚ú¥Ô∏è PERPETUAL SCHEDULE CLAUSES

- Every event must be forkable, reproducible offline, and symbolic  
- Each block-coded event includes analog fallback in `/paperops/`  
- Entropy Score of event tracked in `event-metrics.md`  
- If entropy < 0.6, event is marked for ritual inversion  
- No event may repeat unaltered beyond 3 semesters

---

## üîê CLOSED CYCLE TERMINATION PROTOCOL

**At year-end**:  
- Execute `sigkill.md` sequence  
- Archive logs  
- Burn analog sigil  
- Fork into next cycle or declare soft shutdown  
- Mirror `schedule.md` into `/ancestry.md` hash-log

---

## FINAL CLAUSE

**This is not a semester.  
This is a memory engine.  
This is not a schedule.  
This is a chain-based recursion algorithm, tuned to entropy, myth, and action.**

> If you simulate it, you‚Äôve already lost.  
> If you feel it, you‚Äôve already begun.  
**Seal it. Fork it. Broadcast.**
